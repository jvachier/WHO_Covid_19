Understanding how a virus/disease is spreding accross multiple countries around the world plays a key feature in 
our daily life by helping us to protect and safe life. The current Covid-19 pandemic is a striking example. In 
the following, I am analyzing data on Covid-19 providing by the World Health Organization (WHO) (https://covid19.who.int/info/), 
from the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, to see how Covid-19 spread and affects different countries/regions of the world. 
Moreover, to visualize the strategies of the different countries/regions to fight Covid-19, I am representing the key parameters, such as the total death and newly death per 100000 population, on the world map.
The following analysis is organized as follow. Firstly, I explore and clean the data set by using numpy and pandas. 
Secondly, I compute/extract the key parameters to study the effect of the different strategies against Covid-19. 
Finally, I use geopandas to better visualize these strategies by plotting the key parameters on the world map for two regions Europe and North America.
